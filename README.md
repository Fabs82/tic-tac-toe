# üé≤ Tic-Tac-Toe GUI Edition

A modern, two-player implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a graphical user interface built with the **Ruby2D** gem.

## Project Overview

This project was upgraded from a command-line interface to a full GUI to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, event-driven architecture, and managing external dependencies.

---

## Features ‚ú®

* **Graphical Interface**: Plays on a clean, visually appealing board using **Ruby2D**.
* **Persistent Score Tracker**: Tracks and displays scores for P1 and P2 across multiple matches in the same run.
* **Full Game Logic**: Handles all possible outcomes, including victory by row, column, and diagonal, as well as a draw.
* **Replayability**: After a match ends, players are prompted to start a new game (`Y`) or quit the application (`N`).

---

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Ruby**: Compatible with Ruby 2.5 or higher.
* **Bundler**: Used to manage and install the project's dependencies (gems).
