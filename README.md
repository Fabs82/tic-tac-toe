Tic Tac Toe üé≤

Project Overview
- A Ruby implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game is played via the command line and offers a simple user experience. This project was created with the goal of practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and writing clean and maintainable code.

Features ‚ú®
- Two-player game: Play against a friend on the same computer.

- Game Logic: The program handles all possible outcomes, including victory by row, column, and diagonal, as well as a draw.

- Clean Interface: The game board is displayed clearly and legibly in the command line.

How to Play üïπÔ∏è
- Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system.

- Clone the GitHub repository to your computer.

- Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.

. Run the game with the command: ruby main.rb

- Follow the on-screen instructions to play. When prompted, enter a number from 1 to 9 to place your symbol on the board.

Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- Ruby: The project is compatible with Ruby 3.0 or higher.

- It also requires the 'colorize' Ruby Gem installed

Code Structure üìÇ
- main.rb: The main file that starts the game.

- lib/match.rb: Contains the core game logic, managing turns, victory, and draws.

- lib/player.rb: Defines the Player class, which handles each player's name and symbol.

- lib/gameboard.rb: Defines the Gameboard class, which manages the creation, display, and updating of the game board.
